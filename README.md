Presented at AIP (Association of Indian Physicists)  This presentation covered the theory of light confinement at the nanoscale, focusing on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and Mie scattering. Applications included biosensing, photothermal therapy, and nano-optics, highlighting the role of confined light in advanced technologies.
Light confinement at the nanoscale is a fundamental concept in nanophotonics, where the interaction between light and nanoparticles (NPs) leads to unique optical phenomena. This presentation explored the theoretical foundation of light confinement and its practical applications in modern science and technology.

Theory of Light Confinement
When light interacts with nanoparticles, it can be confined beyond the diffraction limit due to specific optical effects. The two major principles governing this phenomenon are:

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR): In metallic nanoparticles, free electrons collectively oscillate in response to incident light, leading to localized SPR. This effect enhances the electromagnetic field near the nanoparticle surface, making them highly sensitive to changes in the surrounding medium.

Mie Scattering: Dielectric and plasmonic nanoparticles scatter light based on their size and refractive index. This leads to the formation of strong localized optical fields, useful in light manipulation and energy concentration.

Near-Field Enhancement: Light can be confined in nanoscale regions around the particle, significantly increasing intensity in those areas. This effect is crucial for applications like single-molecule detection and surface-enhanced spectroscopies.


Applications of Light Confinement, The ability to confine light to nanoparticles has numerous applications, including:

Biosensing: SPR-based sensors detect biomolecules with high sensitivity, enabling disease diagnostics and molecular detection.

Photothermal Therapy: Plasmonic nanoparticles convert absorbed light into heat, selectively destroying cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissues.

Optoelectronic Devices: Nanoparticle-based structures enhance light absorption in solar cells and improve LED efficiency.

Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS): Enhanced electromagnetic fields boost Raman signal intensity, allowing detection of trace molecules.

Nano-Optical Manipulation: Light confinement aids in the development of high-resolution imaging, optical tweezers, and quantum photonics.
